# DECISION LEDGER — compounding memory (standing reference)

> How the system gets wiser per feature. The conveyor between a one-off decision and the shared
> rulebook, triggered by **recurrence**.
>
> **CAPTURE** — at every gateway the Orchestrator appends each *binding* decision it locked as a row
> below (stable `key` · feature · gate · statement · binding). **DETECT** — at **GATE S** it tallies
> the rows. **GRADUATE** — any key crossing the threshold is promoted into the canonical rulebook.
> **REUSE** — a feature's `BRIEF.md` cites promoted keys in "Invariant watch"; each role restates the
> ones it touches; ORCHESTRATOR §6 forbids reopening them. So each ship can only *add* to the
> constraint envelope the next feature inherits.

## Promotion rule
- **Threshold:** a key present in **≥3 distinct shipped features**, OR **≥2 if every instance is
  `binding:yes`**, graduates at the next GATE S.
- **Binding-only intake:** only a decision a *future feature could violate* enters the ledger (same
  bar as the GATE I decision-impact cull). Incidental implementation choices are not logged.
- **Single-source:** a promoted rule's **prose lives once** in `GAMMAFLOW_CONTEXT.md` §5 (+ a locked
  pointer in `OPEN_THREADS.md` §9). This ledger only **indexes** it — never a second copy (drift risk).
- **Contestable:** a promoted rule is a default, not a cage — reopen via **GATE Z**; the Orchestrator
  then updates/demotes it here and in the canon. Provenance (the earning rows) is retained.

## Promoted canon (key index → where the rule lives)
| key | rule (one line) | lives in | promoted | earned by |
|-----|-----------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | an optional/added computation fails to a null/omitted field, **never an HTTP error**; `market_state`/`strike_profile` + SSE stay intact | CONTEXT §5 · THREADS §9 | 2026-06-22 | dark-pool, dex-voloi-skew-term, trade-tracker-sim, backend-observability, trader-personas (5) |
| `additive-keeps-score-byte-identical` | an additive feature leaves gate / `opportunity_score` / `opportunity_tier` / `state_fingerprint` **byte-identical**; never a scoring input | CONTEXT §5 · THREADS §9 | 2026-06-22 | dex-voloi-skew-term, trade-tracker-sim, backend-observability, trader-personas (4) |
| `live-vs-static-isolation` | every datum declares live-derived vs static; live UI degrades on SSE drop (dim+offline, never blank) while static reads keep rendering | CONTEXT §5 · THREADS §9 | 2026-06-22 | dark-pool, dex-voloi-skew-term, trade-tracker-sim, trader-personas (4) |

> Pre-existing canon (recorded by the ledger, already a rule before it existed — not re-promoted):
> `ai-external-no-llm` (CONTEXT §8) · `dark-pool-context-only` (THREADS §9) · `gamma-sourcing-split`
> (CONTEXT §3 / THREADS §9).

## Watch list (keys logged, not yet at threshold)
- `operator-vs-trader-path-separation` (1 — backend-observability) — an operator-facing surface leaves
  the trader path + computed values untouched and stays off the trader routes. Promote on next recurrence.

## Ledger (append-only — one row per binding decision instance)
| key | feature | gate | statement (as locked) | binding |
|-----|---------|------|-----------------------|---------|
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | dark-pool-stream-isolation | S | any off-exchange failure → `off_exchange=None` (object omitted, not an HTTP error); bundle + SSE intact | yes |
| `live-vs-static-isolation` | dark-pool-stream-isolation | S | live tiles dim + `⏸ offline` on payload-gap watchdog; GEX chart/stats/blocks persist from last bundle | yes |
| `dark-pool-context-only` | dark-pool-stream-isolation | S | block prints display-only, unscored, no side (already canon THREADS §9) | yes |
| `additive-keeps-score-byte-identical` | dex-voloi-skew-term | S | `signals.py` untouched; score + `state_fingerprint` byte-identical with/without the four metrics | yes |
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | dex-voloi-skew-term | S | the four metrics each independently nullable → own "unavailable this cycle" | yes |
| `live-vs-static-isolation` | dex-voloi-skew-term | S | the four are static reads — excluded from the live-offline treatment (stay un-dimmed on SSE drop) | yes |
| `additive-keeps-score-byte-identical` | trade-tracker-sim | S | entry gate + `opportunity_score` + `state_fingerprint` byte-identical to pre-feature | yes |
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | trade-tracker-sim | S | all ghost-trade backend surface best-effort/isolated; missing→404, no-NBBO→null, never breaks bundle | yes |
| `ai-external-no-llm` | trade-tracker-sim | S | stateless server, no order path, **no LLM call** (already canon CONTEXT §8) | yes |
| `live-vs-static-isolation` | trade-tracker-sim | S | SSE drop degrades only P/L + current mark (⏸ last known); record/stats/history persist | yes |
| `additive-keeps-score-byte-identical` | backend-observability | S | `OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED` OFF ⇒ byte-identical bundle; computed values frozen; trader path unchanged | yes |
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | backend-observability | S | instrumentation best-effort — a forced span exception still yields 200 + identical values (never a non-200) | yes |
| `operator-vs-trader-path-separation` | backend-observability | S | metrics readout off the trader routes; SSE uninstrumented; trader dashboard ignores `trace_id`/`timings` | yes |
| `additive-keeps-score-byte-identical` | trader-personas | S | persona = A vs B vs none → byte-identical `market_state`/`signals`/`ai_eval`; persona never a scoring input | yes |
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | trader-personas | S | persona assembly failure → default one-size prompt, never an HTTP error, never blocks bundle/gate/hand-off | yes |
| `ai-external-no-llm` | trader-personas | S | persona assembles text only; AI external, **no LLM call** (already canon CONTEXT §8) | yes |
| `live-vs-static-isolation` | trader-personas | S | persona is presentation-only — fully usable from last bundle, never marked offline | yes |
| `operator-vs-trader-path-separation` | latency-visualizer | S | trend on `/_ops/metrics` only, never linked from a trader route; the page's sole network call stays `GET /api/_metrics`; no control triggers a vendor fetch / recompute / cache mutation / trader-route call | yes |
| `best-effort-isolated-or-null` | latency-visualizer | S | a failed poll keeps the last series behind a soft notice + self-heals (no retry storm, no error page); never affects the page, snapshot tables, or any other surface; the in-browser series is ephemeral (only Export persists, to the operator's machine) | yes |

> Note (GATE S, latency-visualizer): `operator-vs-trader-path-separation` now has **2 binding:yes
> instances** (backend-observability, latency-visualizer) → crosses the "≥2 if all binding" promotion
> threshold; flagged for the Orchestrator to graduate into canon (CONTEXT §5 + THREADS §9) at the
> next gateway.

> Seeded retroactively 2026-06-22 from the five archived features (`OPEN_THREADS.md` §3–§7). Going
> forward, the Orchestrator appends a row per binding decision at each gateway (ORCHESTRATOR §0 step 7).
